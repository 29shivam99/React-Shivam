// to render data on UI 2 ways -

//1. let dom load and then make API call and render - causes lag in UI

// 2.let dom load and make API call and in meanwhile render whatever data u have and then when data is fetched then rerender - better UX - in react we will follow this
//! for 2nd approach we can use useEffect
