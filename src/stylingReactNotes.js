// ways to style react-

// plain css, scss, sass -> not very scalable
// styled components -> used in uber
// using frameworks like chakra UI,  material UI(very famous), ant design (react me popular h ye bhi), tailwind css(becoming famous)

// we will use tailwind css
// tailwind css uses postcss(used for transforming css with JS)

// .postcssrc is configuration file for postcssrc
// we need to mention in postcssrc that we are using tailwind
// parcel uses postcssrc so it reads that tailwind is being used
